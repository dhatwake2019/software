# List of software to install before the DH@Wake Institute
## Required Software
### Mac & Windows
* Sign up for a free account on [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/).
* [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html)  - a tool for helping to organize and edit tabular data at scale
* [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/b/) - required to use the WebScraper Chrome Plugin
* [WebScraper Chrome Plugin](webscraper.io) - allows you to scrape data off of websites
* [Topic Modeling Tool](https://senderle.github.io/topic-modeling-tool/documentation/2017/01/06/quickstart.html) GUI that uses Mallet to create topic models 
* [Postman](http://getpostman.com) - helps you develop an API call

### Mac Only
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (open ’Terminal’ program and paste in the command on the website. This may also prompt you to install XCode - please do so (it may take awhile)) - this is a package manager that makes installing command-line tools easier
* Tesseract (once Homebrew is installed, in Terminal, type `brew install tesseract`) - this performs OCR on images of text

### Windows Only
* [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/install.html) - command-line software with several tools built in
* [Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) - this performs OCR on images of text

## Strongly recommended, but not necessarily required
* A plain text editor (either [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are recommended)
* Spreadsheet software (Excel, [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/), anything that will open a spreadsheet)
* Python 3 (*Windows*: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/; *Mac*: Open Terminal and type `brew install python3`) will be helpful in one of the exercises, but you won't miss out on much if you just watch.
